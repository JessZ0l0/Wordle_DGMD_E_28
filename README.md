Wordle game for HES DGMD_E_28

# Questions Answered:
## API Used: 
I used the Random Word API to generate a random five-letter word for each game because it’s simple, free, and returns clean JSON data ideal for this use case. I also used DictionaryAPI.dev to verify user input was a valid English word. There’s still an issue I need to fix in case the word from the Random Word API isn’t recognized by DictionaryAPI.dev. It’s a future problem to address in order to improve smooth functionality of the game.

## Most Satisfying Part: 
The most satisfying part was seeing the game come to life—especially the confetti animation when a correct word is guessed! It was extremely challenging to integrate multiple features like the letter bank, debug mode, and full-screen sad face. I still believe I require more time fully understand object-oriented programming, however I feel I have a better grasp when I take the time to go step-by-step.
